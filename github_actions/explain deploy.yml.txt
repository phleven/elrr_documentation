Steps Explained:

Checkout Code: Pulls the repository code.

Configure AWS Credentials: Uses GitHub Secrets for secure access to AWS.

Deploy Application: Uploads files to S3 and triggers deployment using AWS CodeDeploy.

3. Configure AWS Resources

a) Create an S3 Bucket

Store deployment artifacts in an S3 bucket:

aws s3 mb s3://your-s3-bucket-name
Copy
b) Set Up CodeDeploy

Create a CodeDeploy application and deployment group in the AWS Management Console.

Install the CodeDeploy agent on your EC2 instances.

c) IAM Role for GitHub Actions

Create an IAM role with permissions for S3, CodeDeploy, and EC2.

Add the role's ARN as a GitHub secret (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY).

4. Trigger Deployment

Push changes to the main branch or manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab.

5. Verify Deployment

Check the deployment status in the AWS CodeDeploy console.

Access your application via the configured load balancer or EC2 instance URL.

Best Practices

Use OpenID Connect (OIDC) for secure authentication instead of long-lived credentials.

Automate testing stages before deployment in your workflow.

Clean up unused resources to avoid unnecessary costs.

This setup ensures seamless integration between GitHub Action
