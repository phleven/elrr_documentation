When you run maven clean install, Maven performs a series of tasks:


Clean: Deletes the target directory, which contains the compiled classes and other build artifacts.
Install: Compiles the code, runs tests, and installs the built artifacts (JARs, POMs, etc.) into the local repository.
Possible Causes and Solutions


Dependency Management in Parent POM:
If your project inherits from a parent POM, ensure that dependencies are correctly managed there. 
Sometimes, dependencies declared in the parent POM can propagate to child modules.


Profiles:
Check if there are any Maven profiles that might be activated during the build process, 
which could be adding dependencies to your POM file.


Plugins:
Some Maven plugins might modify the POM file during the build process. Review your pom.xml for any plugins that 
might be responsible for this behavior.
Steps to Diagnose and Fix


Review pom.xml:
Carefully inspect your pom.xml file for any unexpected dependencies or plugins that might be causing the issue.


Check Effective POM:
Use the mvn help:effective-pom command to see the effective POM that Maven uses during the build. 
his can help you identify where the additional dependencies are coming from.


Clean Local Repository:
Sometimes, issues can arise from stale artifacts in the local repository. 
You can clean your local repository by deleting the .m2/repository directory or specific artifacts within it.


Dependency Tree:
Use the mvn dependency:tree command to visualize the dependency tree and identify any unexpected dependencies.


Example Commands

# View the effective POM
mvn help:effective-pom

# Visualize the dependency tree
mvn dependency:tree


By following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue of dependencies being added to your 
snapshot POM file during the maven clean install process.
