Explanation of the Optimized Parameters:

fetch.min.bytes is set to 1MB to ensure that the consumer waits until at least 1MB of data is available before fetching, thus reducing the number of fetch requests.

fetch.max.bytes is increased to 100MB to allow fetching more data in each request, which reduces overhead.

max.partition.fetch.bytes is set to 10MB, allowing the consumer to fetch a large amount of data per partition.

max.poll.records is increased to 1000 to allow processing more records in each poll, improving throughput.

receive.buffer.bytes and send.buffer.bytes are increased to 1MB to allow larger data transfers between the consumer and broker.

max.in.flight.requests.per.connection is kept at 5, balancing throughput and memory consumption.

Manual offset commit (enable.auto.commit = false) ensures better control over when offsets are committed, which helps avoid unnecessary reprocessing during failures.
