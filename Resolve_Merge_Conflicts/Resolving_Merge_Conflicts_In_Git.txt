Resolving Merge Conflicts in Git


When you encounter the error auto-merging readme.md conflict (add/add): merge conflict in readme.md automatic 
merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result, it means that Git cannot automatically merge the changes
due to conflicting modifications in the readme.md file. You need to resolve these conflicts manually.

Example

$ git merge feature-branch
Auto-merging readme.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in readme.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result
Steps to Resolve Merge Conflicts

1. Identify Conflicted Files

	a. Run git status to see which files have conflicts
	git status
	
	On branch master
	You have unmerged paths
	(fix conflicts and run "git commit")
	(use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)
	
	Unmerged paths:
	(use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)
	both modified: readme.md



2. Open and Edit Conflicted Files

Open the conflicted file (readme.md) in a text editor. 
You'll see conflict markers like <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>

This is a new README file

<<<<<<< HEAD
This is an edit on the master branch
=======
This is an edit on the feature branch
>>>>>>> feature-branch
Edit the file to resolve the conflicts, removing the conflict markers.

This is a new README file

This is an edit on the master branch and feature branch combined



3. Mark Conflicts as Resolved

After editing, mark the file as resolved by adding it to the staging area
git add readme.md



4. Commit the Merge

Finally, commit the merge to complete the process
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in readme.md"
By following these steps, you can resolve merge conflicts and successfully complete your merge.
