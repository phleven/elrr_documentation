To sort POM file

If you want to run the SortPom plugin from commandline, it will be more convenient if you add a Plugin group
to your general Maven Settings. 

To do this, open up "C:\apache-maven-3.9.9\conf\settings.xml" and add the following plugin group:

<settings>
	...
	<pluginGroups>
  		<pluginGroup>com.github.ekryd.sortpom</pluginGroup>
	</pluginGroups>
	...
</settings>

You can then omit the full specification for the plugin and run

mvn sortpom:sort

Create a backup and sort:
mvn sortpom:verify
