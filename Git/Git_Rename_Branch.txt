Renaming a Branch



Renaming a Branch on GitHub:
1. Navigate to the Repository: Go to the main page of the repository on GitHub.

2. Access Branches: From the file tree view on the left, select the branch dropdown menu, then click "View all branches."

3. ename the Branch: Next to the branch you want to rename, select the dropdown menu, then click "Rename branch."

4. Enter New Name: Type a new name for the branch.

5. Confirm Rename: Review the information about local environments, then click "Rename branch".

When you rename a branch, any URLs containing the old branch name are automatically redirected to the equivalent URL 
for the renamed branch. Branch protection policies and the base branch for open pull requests are also updated.




Updating a Local Clone After Renaming:

After renaming a branch on GitHub, collaborators with a local clone of the repository need to update their local 
environment. Here are the commands to update the branch name locally:

git branch -m OLD-BRANCH-NAME NEW-BRANCH-NAME
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/NEW-BRANCH-NAME NEW-BRANCH-NAME
git remote set-head origin -a

Optionally, you can remove tracking references to the old branch name with:
git remote prune origin



Renaming a Local Branch:

Rename the Current Branch: If you are on the branch you want to rename, use:
git branch -m NEW-BRANCH-NAME

Rename a Different Branch: If you are on a different branch, use:
git branch -m OLD-BRANCH-NAME NEW-BRANCH-NAME



Renaming a Remote Branch:

Renaming a remote branch involves deleting the old branch and pushing the renamed branch. Follow these steps:

Delete the Old Branch:

git push origin --delete OLD-BRANCH-NAME
Push the Renamed Branch:
git push origin -u NEW-BRANCH-NAME
