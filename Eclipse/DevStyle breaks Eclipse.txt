DevStyle Breaks Eclipse



To Fix:
1. From your eclipse installation folder, delete all folders and jars with com.genuitec.eclipse. 
2. Delete the following folder <ECLIPSE>\configuration\org.eclipse.osgi\


1.  At the moment the solution seems to be to delete anything com.genuitec.* from .p2\pool\plugins, 
start a new workspace, then uninstall Darkest Dark from the Eclipse Marketplace view. 

After that I was able to start my old workspaces normally.
