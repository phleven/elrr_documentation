Hey Phil, I know it’s pretty late, but I wanted to get this down before I forget tomorrow, maybe you can give it a try in the morning.
 
I have a hunch your issue might be because there are some commits in the history that don’t have an assigned key (probably from GitHub and not squashed already). Here’s what I think we could do:
Go back to the ci-datasync2 branch.
Run: git reset --soft master

We can use this commend to squash the commit history, and it will move all the commits back to the staging (basically going back to git add .)
Then run:
git commit -S -m "Merge branch main from GH"
Then run:
git push p1 ci-datasync2
I think this should let you push without any issues since now all the commits in the commit history will have a key attached to them
 

 
ok
